  <h2>so how'd you build such a cool site?</h2>
  <p>Glad you asked. Here's the tech behind it.</p>
  <hr />
  <ul>
      <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> -- A clean and lightweight content management system. It's database-free, generating static pages using HTML and fairly simple markdown.</li>
      <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> -- Instead of paying for web hosting services, I use their public repository to store and serve my Jekyll-generated pages.</li>
      <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> -- I'm using this for the layout and web framework for the site. An impressive set of tools for configuring HTML, CSS (using SASS), and implementing JavaScript libraries.</li>
      <li><a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a> -- A great icon library. And it's free.</li>
      <li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/">iwantmyname</a> -- Where I register all my domains. It's a great service, free of the crap and upselling you get from other domain registrars.</li>
      <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> -- Currently my most favorite text editor.</li>
  </ul>

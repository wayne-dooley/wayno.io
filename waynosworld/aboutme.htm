I made my grand entrance on February 16, 1959 in Detroit, Michigan.  I spent the first few years of my life in Illinois, and later moved to California when my dad got a job with NASA.  He later went to work for National Radio Astronomy Observatories, and started work on their <a href="http://info.aoc.nrao.edu/vla/html/VLAhome.shtml">VLA radio telescope project</a>.  This required a move to Virginia for my 10th grade year, and then finishing high school at New Mexico in '77.<p>I attended one year of college at New Mexico Tech studying computer science.  It was a great year: lot's of fun, but only completing 12 semester hours! Realizing I <i>might</i> not have the discipline for college work at that time, I joined the New Mexico Air National Guard in '78 to get a permanent position with the computer services department.  When the government job I was to get after completing basic military training disappeared, I decided to enter active duty.<p>My first active duty tour was at McGuire AFB, New Jersey.  Two years later I transferred to Reese AFB, Texas where, a year after a very brief first marriage (don't ask), I met my wife Susan on a blind date.  We were married 8 months later, in Nov '83.  Within two years we 'pulled chocks' for a three year tour to (then) West Germany.  We came back to Brooks AFB, San Antonio, Texas in '88.  After three years there, I was 'nominated' (i.e. involuntarily selected) for a special duty assignment at the Pentagon.  We had the joyous privilege to spend 5 years of our lives in the "District of Criminals".  We bounced back to Randolph AFB, San Antonio, Texas in '96 where I worked as a software development project manager at the Air Force Personnel Center.  Then, on May 12, 2000, I bid the Air Force farewell and 'retired' to start a second career.<p>

After a short break, I started civilian work in July '00 as an MIS Project Manager with <a href="http://www.arrow.com">Arrow Electronics</a> on Long Island, New York.  There, I primarily managed infrastructure related projects, assisting with renovations, relocations, and decommissioning of Arrow facilities in North America.  In keeping with my tradition of not staying in one place too long, I convinced my boss to let me transfer to the Arrow Denver facility in July '01.  Three weeks after arriving in Colorado, my section was 'downsized' (i.e. shut down).  I asked my wife to stop unpacking boxes until I found a new job.  I spent the following three months on a job search, and landed a job in California.  The movers loaded us up again, and we continued west to the coast.<p>
We settled into Mission Viejo, California in October '01.  I started contract work as a project manager with <a href="http://www.compuwizardsusa.com">CompuWizards</a>, on assignment to <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com">Verizon Wireless</a> at their West Area headquarters in Irvine.  I was working in the information technology (IT) department, managing real estate projects that have an IT impact for a twelve state region.  Unfortunately, the telecommunications market experienced a 'slight' downturn, shifting the focus away from real estate, and consequently putting me on the street after five months. Then through a series of fortunate events, I landed a job back in Denver.  We packed our bags once again, and headed east.<p>
<dt><b>Where I'm at...</b><br>
<dd>We moved back to Denver in July '02.  I'm now (and hopefully for a long time) working for the <a href="http:\\www.ch2m.com">CH2M Hill corporation</a>.  I'm the manager of the human resource management systems (HRMS) at corporate headquarters.  I manage a staff of eight developers and analysts who maintain the human resources, payroll, and benefits computer systems corporate-wide.<p>

<dt><b>Where I'm going...</b><br>
<dd>Taking a deep breath, and settling back into the Colorado lifestyle.  Hopefully all will remain calm for just a little while...<p>
Stay tuned...

Computer Haiku<p>
</font>
<font class="normal">
Imagine if instead of cryptic, geeky test strings, your computer produced error messages in haiku...  
<p>
Your file is quite large<br>
and might be very useful,<br>
but now it is gone.
<p>
The Web site you seek<br>
cannot be located, but<br>
endless others exist.
<p>
Chaos reigns within.<br>
Reflect, repent, and reboot.<br>
Order shall return.
<p>
ABORTED effort:<br>
Close all that you have.<br>
You ask far too much.
<p>
First snow, then silence.<br>
This thousand dollar screen dies<br>
so beautifully.
<p>
With searching comes loss<br>
and the presence of absence:<br>
"My Novel" not found.
<p>
The Tao that is seen<br>
Is not the true Tao, until<br>
You bring fresh toner.
<p>
Windows NT crashed.<br>
I am the Blue Screen of Death.<br>
No one hears your screams.
<p>
Stay the patient course;<br>
Of little worth is your ire;<br>
The network is down.
<p>
A crash reduces<br>
your expensive computer<br>
to a simple stone.
<p>
Yesterday it worked;<br>
Today it is not working:<br>
Windows is like that.
<p>
Three things are certain:<br>
Death, taxes, and lost data.<br>
Guess which has occurred.
<p>
You step in the stream,<br>
but the water has moved on.<br>
This page is not here.
<p>
Out of memory.<br>
We wish to hold the whole sky,<br>
but we never will.
<p>
Having been erased,<br>
the document you're seeking<br>
must now be retyped.
<p>
Rather than a beep<br>
or a rude error message,<br>
these words: "File not found."
<p>
Serious error.<br>
All shortcuts have disappeared.<br>
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

Obtain a 55-gallon box of Legos (if Legos are not available, you may substitute roofing tacks or broken bottles).  Have a friend spread them all over the house.  Put on a blindfold.  Try to walk to the bathroom or kitchen.  Do not scream (this could wake a child at night).
<p>
<b>Grocery Store Test</b>

<p>
<b>Night Test</b>
<p>
Prepare by obtaining a small cloth bag and fill it with 8 to 12 pounds of sand.  Soak it thoroughly in water.  At 8:00 pm begin to waltz and hum with the bag until 9:00 PM.  Lay down your bag and set your alarm for 10:00 pm.  Get up, pick up your bag, and sing every song you have ever heard.  Make up about a dozen more songs and sing these too until 4:00 am.  Set alarm for 5:00 am.  Get up and make breakfast.  Keep this up for 5 years.  Look cheerful.
<p>
<b>Physical Test (Women) </b>
<p>
Obtain a large beanbag chair and attach it to the front of your clothes.  Leave it there for 9 months.  Now remove 10% of the beans.
<p>
<b>Physical Test (Men) </b>
<p>
Go to the nearest drug store.  Set your wallet on the counter.  Ask the clerk to help himself.  Now proceed to the nearest food store.  Go to the head office and arrange for your paycheck to be directly deposited to the store.  Purchase a newspaper.  Go home and read it quietly for the last time.
<p>
<b>Final Assignment</b>
<p>
Find a couple who has a small child.  Lecture them on how they can improve their discipline, patience, tolerance, toilet training, and child's table manners.  Suggest many ways they can improve.  Emphasize to them that they should never allow their children to run riot.  Enjoy this experience.  It will be the last time you will have all the answers.

The conversation grew more heated and at   least 10 men trooped along the walkway of the bridge at 4:30 a.m.  Upon   arrival at the midpoint of the bridge they discovered that no one had    brought  bungee rope.  Bingham, who had continued drinking, volunteered and pointed    out  that a coil of lineman's cable lay nearby.  One end of the cable was    secured  around Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the bridge.  His fall   lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and tore his foot off at the    ankle.  He miraculously survived his fall into the icy river water and was rescued    by  two nearby fishermen. "All I can say," said Bingham, "is that God was    watching  out for me on that night; there's just no other explanation for it."   Bingham's foot was never located. --

What If People Bought Cars Like They Bought Computers?<p>
</font>
<font class="normal">
GM, Ford or Chrysler don't have a "help line" for people who don't know how

imagine if they did...

HELPLINE:  "GM helpline, how can I help you?"<br>
CUSTOMER:  "I got in my car and closed the door, and nothing happened?"<br>
HELPLINE:  Did you put the key in the ignition slot and turn it?<br>
CUSTOMER:  What's an ignition?<br>
HELPLINE: It's a starter motor that draws current from you battery and turns
over the engine.<br>
CUSTOMER:  Ignition? Motor? Battery?  Engine?  How come I have to know all
of these technical terms just to use my car??!!
<p>
HELPLINE:  Chrysler Helpline, how can I help you?<br>
CUSTOMER:  My car ran for a week and now it won't go anywhere?<br>
HELPLINE:  Is the gas tank empty?<br>
CUSTOMER:  Huh?  How do I know?<br>

markings that go from 'E' to 'F'.  Where is the needle pointing?<br>
CUSTOMER:  It's pointing to 'E', what does that mean?<br>
HELPLINE: It means that you have to visit a gasoline vendor and purchase
some more gasoline.  You can install it yourself, or pay the vendor to do it
for you.<br>

have to keep buying more components??!!  I want a car that comes with
everything built in!!

way to the floor.  It worked for a while, and then it crashed  --- and now
it won't start!<br>
HELPLINE:  It's your responsibility if you misuse the product.  What do you
expect us to do about it?<br>

HELPLINE:  GM helpline, how may I help you?<br>

When you're having a bad day<p>
</font>
<font class="normal">
<i>Part I ...</i>
<p>
Now get this. I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call had to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered nicely saying, "Hello?" I politely said, "This is Patrick Hannifin and could I please speak to Robin Carter?" Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude.
<p>
I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. She had transposed the last two digits.
<p>
After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again. When the same person once more answered, I yelled "You're a jerk!" and hung up.
<p>
Next to his phone number I wrote the word "Jerk," and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up. He'd answer, and then I'd yell, 'You're a jerk!" It would always cheer me up.
<p>
Later in the year the phone company introduced caller ID. This was a real disappointment for me, I would have to stop calling the jerk. Then one day I had an idea. I dialed his number, then heard his voice, "Hello." I made up a name. "Hi. This is Herman with the telephone company and I'm just calling to see if you're familiar with our caller ID program?" He went, "No!" and slammed the phone down. I quickly called him back and said, "That's because you're a jerk!" And the reason I took the time to tell you this story, is to show you how if there's ever anything really bothering you, you can do something about it. Just dial 722-XXXX.
<p>
<i>Part II ...</i>
<p>
The old lady at the mall really took her time pulling out of the parking space. I didn't think she was ever going to leave. Finally her car began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the stall. I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out. Great, I thought, she's finally leaving. All of a sudden this black Camaro come flying up the parking aisle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space. I started honking my horn and yelling, "You can't just do that, Buddy. I was here first!" The guy climbed out of his Camaro completely ignoring me. He walked toward the mall as if he didn't even hear me. I thought to myself, this guy's a jerk, there's sure a lot of jerks in this world. I noticed he had a For Sale sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the number. Then I hunted for another place to park.
<p>
A couple of days later, I'm at home sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling 722-XXXX and yelling, "You're a jerk!" (It's really easy to call him now since I have his number on speed dial). I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black Camaro lying on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy, too. After a couple rings someone answered the phone and said, "Hello." I said, "Is this the man with the black Camaro for sale?" "Yes it is." "Can you tell me where I can see it?"
<p>
"Yes, I live at XXXX West 34th street. It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front.
<p>
I said, "What's your name?"
<p>
"My name is Don Hansen." "When's a good time to catch you, Don?"
<p>
"I'm home in the evenings."
<p>
"Listen Don, can I tell you something?"
<p>
"Yes." "Don, you're a jerk!" And I slammed the phone down. After I hung up I added Don Hansen's number to my speed dialer.
<p>
For a while things seemed to be going better for me. Now when I had a problem I had two jerks to call. Then after several months of calling the jerks and hanging up on them, the whole thing started to seem like an obligation. It just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution. First, I had my phone dial Jerk #1. A man answered nicely saying, "Hello." I yelled "You're a jerk!" But I didn't hang up. The jerk said, "Are you still there?" I said, "Yeah.."
<p>
He said, "Stop calling me." I said, "No." He said, "What's your name, Pal?" I said, "Don Hansen." "Where do you live?"
<p>
"XXXX West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black Camaro's  parked out front." "I'm coming over right now, Don. You'd better start saying your  prayers." "Yeah, like I'm really scared, Jerk!" and I hung up. Then I called Jerk #2. He answered, "Hello." I said, "Hello, Jerk!"
<p>
He said, "If I ever find out who you are..."
<p>
"You'll what?"
<p>
"I'll kick your butt." "Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now Jerk!" And I hung up. Then I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them a big gang fight was going down at XXXX West 34th Street. After that I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing. I turned onto 34th Street and parked my car under the shade of a tree half a block from Jerk #2's house. There were two guys fighting out front. Suddenly there were about 12 police cars and a helicopter. The police wrestled the two men to the ground and took them away.

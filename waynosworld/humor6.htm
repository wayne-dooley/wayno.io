The Fourth of July<br>
</font>
<font class="normal">
by Steven Martin Cohen 
<p>
Once upon a time in a town very far away from anyplace that ever made any sense, there was a pond just outside the village square.  Lovers would walk hand in hand along the trail near the water's edge, mindful not to break any of the numerous town ordinances about how friendly couples could and could not get in public, and exactly what combinations of genders those couples could consist of in this good old fashioned family-values town burgeoning with lily-white rosy-cheeked boys and girls frolicking in the summer sun.  Mothers pushed their baby strollers, and people would picnic on the grass along side the lake. Children would feed the ducks and cast their lines into the water in hopes of snagging a sunfish or a carp.  Life was good in this small American town.
<p>
Then, one day, the city fathers needed to find a way to spend up some extra money before the end of the year, because they knew that a surplus of accumulating cash could lead to lower taxes, less town revenue, and fewer justifiable contracts to their friends who fed them kickbacks to help pay for that apartment over in Sin City where they stashed the mistress and spent most of their time finding kinkier reasons to take massive dosages of antibiotics not issued by the hometown HMO.
<p>
So in marched the men wearing hardhats who took enough water samples from the town lake to fill the Mayor's swimming pool that mysteriously appeared in his back yard shortly after the main road had been re-paved with blacktop that buckled up in heaving dunes and sinuous waves the day the mercury hit the staggering heights of 82 on the Fahrenheit scale. That was back in late April, and lo and behold, on the day of the next town council meeting, the water sample people presented their findings. "Feces!" the engineer exclaimed with the disgust and certainty of a civil servant standing neck high in a cesspool of hidden agendas. "There's too much feces from the ducks in the pond, and the O2 level is dropping."  No one knew or cared what O2 was, but, after spending a lifetime in politics, they were all quite familiar with feces, so they listened as if they were scientists setting out to save the planet.  "My recommendation," the engineer continued, "is that the fair citizens of this town must stop feeding the ducks, then those ducks will stop producing all that feces."  The town fathers nodded their heads in agreement, and all those in favor said: Aye.
<p>
They promptly enacted a law making it illegal to feed the ducks, and, as could only be expected, this pissed off an awful lot of ducks who were as used to a free handout as the welfare baby factories over in Sin City.  Ducks have no political lobby though, and, being only a bunch of uneducated ducks, they did the things uneducated ducks do:  they walked all over town, panhandling and looking for some food.  They marched in great white quacking migratory herds across people's lawns loudly serenading the folks as they ate their rich dinners, stuffing their faces with the very things the ducks had grown accustomed to eating in their laid-back suburban life style before the council waged this unconstitutional discriminatory genocidal war against them. Many citizens could not bear the quacking cries of the hungry ducks, so a highly sophisticated secret feeding network evolved to save the ducks from sure starvation, slow death, and, perhaps, an untimely appearance on somebody's plate.  People would scurry through the storm drainage system, and food would appear outside various grates and manhole covers around town.
<p>
But what goes in one end of a duck naturally comes squeezing out the other end someplace else, this time, all over the lawns of wealthy white people who pay Mexican gardeners hundreds of dollars a month to maintain those lawns.  Property owners complained, but the ducks had become a great money generating enterprise for the town.  Special police armed with video cameras and night scopes caught people on camera giving free handouts to the ducks, and the town revenue soared as the courts grew clogged with case after case of duck-feeding law-breakers subsequently charged with several escalating classes of feeding misdemeanors and felonies.  Law practices sprang up overnight.  Local colleges offered masters programs in the emerging field of duck law.  More judges and stenographers had to be hired.  Then there were the posters and the T-shirts and other spin-off industries.  A television series had been proposed.  Deal makers had their eyes on opportunities undreamt of only a few short months earlier.  Duck's rights activists began demonstrating in the center of town, but when a bus load of outsiders showed up with their signs and bags of fresh bread, they were all arrested, tried, and sent off to prison to serve long sentences without parole.  Times were good for the village, because with all that extra traffic, the roads needed re-paving, and it was around that time that the Mayor's new deck sprouted from the ground like a summer beef tomato.
<p>
It was also around that time that one of the fine citizens grew tired of shelling out hundreds of bucks worth of tickets every time one of his kids got caught on camera illegally feeding the ducks.  Since he was the local Krazy Glue distributor, he cautiously lured all the ducks into his yard with the bread crumbs he surreptitiously laced the ground with, and while a decoy feeding operation over on the other side of the lake drew the attention of the duck detectives, he squirted a little shot of glue up the asshole of each of the town ducks to prevent them from defecating all over his increasingly greasy lawn.
<p>
Now a little bit of Krazy Glue can go a long way, as this distributor always told his customers, and the ducks didn't seem to mind all that much; in fact, they rather liked it in a perverse sort of way, being that they were only uneducated ducks and could not see the grander picture unfolding before them.  For the next few days, they acted as if nothing were wrong.  They would race toward unsuspecting visiting tourists, quack, and act like the cute ducks that they were. Invariably, the tourists would feel sorry for the ducks, feed them a piece of sandwich, and the next thing these tourists knew, they got their asses hauled off to court where they were promptly arraigned and not only fined for their feeding improprieties, but charged for court expenses to boot.  In the mean time, the ducks grew fatter and slower, and the O2 level rose, as the city engineer predicted it would.  The lake thrived with all sorts of polysyllabic organisms that are normally killed off by the creature that feed upon the organisms that eat the duck feces, and the ecosystem thrived in its own uniquely distorted way.  The duck dicks, as the detectives came to be designated, noticed the ducks growing excessively large and lethargic, and they knew in their hearts that someone was evading their infrared surveillance in some deviously sneaky way as yet to be discovered.  More consultants were hired, and they collected as much overtime as they could physically tolerate, spying with their telephoto lenses and filming and digitally processing the images on their new high-tech image analysis system the town had procured for their new logistics and command center, along with the post graduate student operator who had gotten his Ph.D in real time convolution integrals and deblurring technology as a result of all that spill down peace dividend talent seeping its way back into the public sector economy.  The Mayor was enjoying a vacation in Bermuda with his brand new bare-breasted Polynesian secretary, who didn't take standard dictation, while his wrinkled prune of a wife told the ladies at the lawn party that he was researching advanced management techniques at a conference of Mayors in Cleveland.  She really did think that's where he was, and the town ducks grew still fatter and lazier, with their little ducky anuses coated with a fine film of cyanoacrylate cement.
<p>
Now, the Fourth of July was a major event in town, and people from miles around would come to watch the fireworks exhibit over the lake. Thousands would sit on the lawn, drink beer, publicly urinate, eat popcorn and cotton candy, and feed the ducks, which, of course, was illegal this year.  By now the ducks were so large they could barely float, and they didn't look so good as far as ducks go.  They clumped together in the center of the lake, low in the water, like bulging tankers on their way to the refineries.  The Mayor had just returned from another working vacation, and he stepped to the podium to give his famous speech about America and freedom and the opportunity to do whatever the heck you want in this great land of ours, as long as it wasn't feeding the ducks.  It grew dark, the crowd grew bored, and then the fireworks show began.  Shells from mortars exploded high in the sky, and dazzling phosphor trails radiated in all directions displaying every blazing color of the rainbow.
<p>
Then, through the rocket's red glare, with bombs bursting in air, a duck suddenly and quite unexpectedly lifted off the surface of the water, like a buzzing balloon released from between a pair of slippery fingers.  The duck sputtered and spiraled skyward as its intestines emptied through a ruptured nozzle, propelling it with the force of a water rocket, and it accelerated up, up, and away, beyond the thousand points of light in the sky.  Even Krazy glue has a design limit, and in the blink of an eye, another duck whistled off, out of control, spraying its accumulated load into the dazzled and awe-struck crowd below.  And one by one, as America celebrated another proud birthday, these poor astonished ducks, completely unaware of this cruel physics anomaly of gastronomical pressure release, burst forth from the water like angry Polaris missiles, never to be seen again.  The city engineer threw his arms up in despair while contemplating plummeting O2 levels, but the crowd applauded with every dramatic fine feathered departure from the surface of the lake.  At first, even the Mayor thought this was a rather impressive special effect, but he learned otherwise when the fireworks subcontractor sued the town because this duck thing was not mentioned in his contract.  Many appeals later, the aberrant case of duck law was brought before the state, and ultimately the Federal court, where the town was finally ordered to pay the fireworks company $4.6 million for breech of contract and damaging the fine reputation of a highly-respected group of pyrotechnicians, who, by now, were spending an increasing amount of time on the psychiatrist's couch learning to deal with their complex stress management issues.
<p>
The Mayor was re-elected on a platform that he would drain the lake and transform the new landfilled real estate into a shopping mall.  Though many people liked the lake, the fish, and the ducks, they caved in when it was explained with charts, graphs, overhead slides, and fancy animated web sites that it would bring in fresh capital to help pay off the lawsuit award for that fireworks disaster.  Now the Mayor has aluminum siding and a funky little Japanese garden next to the pool, and when his wife visits Vegas with her friends, he can often be seen sipping wine and eating a fine meal with his Polynesian secretary in the posher districts of Sin City, where no one has ever seen a duck behave in any manner other than assuming the succulent candle-lit resting position in the medium-rare environment of a plate, surrounded by vegetables and sauce, followed, of course, by a little something extra after the meal, proving once again, that ducks exist for one and only one purpose in life.
<p>
Bon appetit.

<p>
In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.
<p>
Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.
<p>

The Parrot
</font>
<font class="normal">
<p>
David received a parrot for his birthday. The parrot was fully grown and came with a bad attitude and a worse vocabulary. Every other word was an expletive. Those that weren't expletives were, to say the least, rude. David tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly using polite language, playing soft music; he did anything he could think of to set a good example. Nothing worked. He yelled at the bird, the bird got worse. He shook the bird and it only became angry and ruder. Finally, in a moment of desperation, David put the parrot in the freezer. For a few moments he heard the bird squawking and kicking and screaming and then, suddenly, there was quiet. David, frightened that he might have actually hurt the bird, quickly opened the freezer door. To his astonishment, the parrot calmly stepped out onto David's extended arm and said: "I'm sorry that I might have offended you with my language and behavior and I beg your forgiveness. I will endeavor to correct my behavior." David was completely bemused by the bird's change in attitude and was about to ask what had caused it when the parrot continued: "May I ask what the chicken did?"

There once was a young person named Little Red Riding Hood who lived on the edge of a large forest full of endangered owls and rare plants that would probably provide a cure for cancer if only someone took the time to study them. Red Riding Hood lived with a nurture giver whom she sometimes referred to as "mother," although she didn't mean to imply by this term that she would have thought less of the person if a close biological link did not in fact exist. Nor did she intend to denigrate the equal value of non traditional households, although she was sorry if this was the impression conveyed. One day her mother asked her to take a basket of organically grown fruit and mineral water to her grandmother's house. "But mother, won't this be stealing work from the unionized people who have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages between various people in the woods?" Red Riding Hood's mother assured her that she had called the union boss and gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form. "But mother, aren't you oppressing me by ordering me to do this?" Red Riding Hood's mother pointed out that it was impossible for women to oppress each other, since all women were equally oppressed until all women were free. "But mother, then shouldn't you have my brother carry the basket, since he's an oppressor, and should learn what it's like to be oppressed?" And Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her brother was attending a special rally for animal rights, and besides, this wasn't stereotypical women's work, but an empowering deed that would help engender a feeling of community. "But won't I be oppressing Grandma, by implying that she's sick and hence unable to independently further her own selfhood?" But Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her grandmother wasn't actually sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way, although that was not to imply that any of these conditions were inferior to what some people called "health". Thus Red Riding Hood felt that she could get behind the idea of delivering the basket to her grandmother, and so she set off. Many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerous place, but Red Riding Hood knew that this was an irrational fear based on cultural paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regarded the natural world as an exploitable resource, and hence believed that natural predators were in fact intolerable competitors. Other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants, but Red Riding Hood felt that in a truly classless society all marginalized peoples would be able to "come out" of the woods and be accepted as valid lifestyle role models. On her way to Grandma's house, Red Riding Hood passed a wood chopper, and wandered off the path, in order to examine some flowers. She was startled to find herself standing before a Wolf, who asked her what was in her basket. Red Riding Hood's teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers, but she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality, and chose to dialogue with the Wolf. She replied, "I am taking my Grandmother some healthful snacks in a gesture of solidarity." The Wolf said, "You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl to walk through these woods alone." Red Riding Hood said, "I find your sexist remark offensive in the extreme, but I will ignore it because of your traditional status as an outcast from society, the stress of which has caused you to develop an alternative and yet entirely valid world view. Now, if you'll excuse me, I would prefer to be on my way." Red Riding Hood returned to the main path, and proceeded towards her Grandmother's house. But because his status outside society had freed him from slavish adherence to linear, Western-style thought, the Wolf knew of a quicker route to Grandma's house. He burst into the house and ate Grandma, a course of action affirmative of his nature as a predator. Then, unhampered by rigid, traditionalist gender role notions, he put on Grandma's nightclothes, crawled under the bedclothes, and awaited developments. Red Riding Hood entered the cottage and said, "Grandma, I have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you in your role of wise and nurturing matriarch." The Wolf said softly "Come closer, child, so that I might see you." Red Riding Hood said, "Goddess! Grandma, what big eyes you have!" "You forget that I am optically challenged." "And Grandma, what an enormous, what a fine nose you have." "Naturally, I could have had it fixed to help my acting career, but I didn't give in to such societal pressures, my child." "And Grandma, what very big, sharp teeth you have!" The Wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs, and, in a reaction appropriate for his accustomed milieu, he leaped out of bed, grabbed Little Red Riding Hood, and opened his jaws so wide that she could see her poor Grandmother cowering in his belly. "Aren't you forgetting something?" Red Riding Hood bravely shouted. "You must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of intimacy!" The Wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his grasp on her. At the same time, the wood chopper burst into the cottage, brandishing an ax. "Hands off!" cried the wood chopper. "And what do you think you're doing?" cried Little Red Riding Hood. "If I let you help me now, I would be expressing a lack of confidence in my own abilities, which would lead to poor self esteem and lower achievement scores on college entrance exams." "Last chance, sister! Get your hands off that endangered species! This is an FBI sting!" screamed the wood chopper, and when Little Red Riding Hood nonetheless made a sudden motion, he sliced off her head. "Thank goodness you got here in time," said the Wolf. "The brat and her grandmother lured me in here. I thought I was a goner." "No, I think I'm the real victim here," said the wood chopper. "I've been dealing with my anger ever since I saw her picking those protected flowers earlier. And now I'm going to have such a trauma. Do you have any aspirin?" "Sure," said the Wolf. "Thanks." "I feel your pain," said the Wolf, and he patted the wood chopper on his firm, well padded back, gave a little belch, and said "Do you have any Maalox?"  <p>

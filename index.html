      <p class="text-white">And welcome to yet another resurrection of my personal web presence. Iâ€™ve built quite a few of these over the years, and like any good side project, it just keeps evolving.</p>
      <p class="text-white">I'm a technical project manager and contract digital applications developer. I've worked remotely from Texas for the past eleven years, making the most of modern tech and the good fortune of working with thoughtful, forward-looking teams. Before that, I held a variety of tech roles, and served 21 years active duty in the U.S. Air Force.</p>
      <p class="text-white">I'm also a hobbyist woodworker, gradually leveling up my skills (and my tools). My wife doesn't mind that I've taken over the garage as a woodshop, as long as I periodically build her items of tribute. I also enjoy photography, movies, social media, and tinkering with personal projects like this one.</p>
      <p class="text-white mb-5">Stay tuned. Or not. Either way, thanks for stopping by.</p>

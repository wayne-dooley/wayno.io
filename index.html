      <p class="text-white">And welcome to yet another resurrection of my personal web presence. </p>
      <p class="text-white">I'm a technical project manager and web developer for the National Institutes of Health. I've worked remotely from Texas for the past seven years, thoroughly enjoying the advantages of modern technology and the progressive thinking of my awesome leadership. I've held a number of other technology jobs prior to this, and served 21 years active duty in the US Air Force.</p>
      <p class="text-white">I'm also an active woodworker, slowly working my way from novice level. My wife doesn't mind that I've taken over the garage as a woodshop, as long as I periodically build her items as tribute. I also enjoy photography, movies, social media, and building the occasional personal website.</p>
      <p class="text-white mb-5">Stay tuned. Or not. Either way, thanks for stopping by.</p>
